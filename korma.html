    <p>Serve with rice or naan breads.</p>

    <ul>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>225g block of paneer, cut into 2cm cubes</li>
      <li>1 large onion, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled</li>
      <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
      <li>5 tbsp korma paste</li>
      <li>3 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
      <li>70g ground almonds</li>
      <li>500ml vegetable stock</li>
      <li>150g spinach</li>
      <li>100g Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>rice or naan breads, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a deep frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add
        the paneer cubes and fry for 5 mins, turning regularly, so each side is
        golden brown. Remove with tongs and put on a plate lined with kitchen
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor with a splash of
        water and blitz until completely smooth. Heat the remaining oil in the
        frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion mixture and a pinch of
        salt, and fry for 10 mins or until lightly golden. Add the korma paste
        and cardamom, and fry for 1 min. Stir in the ground almonds and fry for
        1 min to make a thick paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for 5-10 mins, uncovered, or
        until reduced a little. Add the spinach to the sauce and cook for 5
        mins. Stir through the yogurt and paneer, and season generously. Serve
        with rice or warm naan breads.
      </li>
    </ol>
